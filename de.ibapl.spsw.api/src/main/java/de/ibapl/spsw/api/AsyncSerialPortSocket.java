/**
 * An asynchronous IO socket.
 * This should be an for async IO optimized socket.
 * If the data can be read/written without waiting they should read/write with the calling thread. If not, an internal thread reads/writes the data.
 * All callbacks should be done with the currently used thread.
 * 
 * If a read/write finishes wihtout waiting, the calling thread of the callback is the thread that called read/write.
 * If an internal thread was used that thread calls the callbacks.
 * 
 * So if you just need to "fast" process the read/written data, use the thread that calls the callback. If you need "more time" - use some different thread to do so.
 * 
 * This interface is experimental.
